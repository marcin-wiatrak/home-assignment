# Notes

Hey, I'm glad you're here! I've created this project to showcase my skills in React, Typescript and CSS skills.
During the last check I found out that I completely forget about one functionality in sorting. It's moving tasks under other task (turn task into subtask of other one and vice versa). If you want me to implement this feature, please let me know.

Also, I added modal (not beautiful, but functional) to add new task. I was completely out of idea how it should look like, so left it **AS IT IS** just to show functionality
